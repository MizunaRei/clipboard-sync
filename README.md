# Clipboard Sync

A simple tool which helps to sync the clipboard between computers by using a shared folder.

In other words, if you have a shared folder between your computers (including OneDrive and other folder synchronization tools), this tool helps you sync your clipboard by leveraging it.

## Get Started

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/felipecrs/clipboard-sync/releases/latest) for your platform and open it.

When running for the first time, the tool will ask you which folder to use for synchronizing the clipboard. Select the same shared folder between your computers in both of them.

## Tips

Some tips depending on which folder synchronization tool that you are using.

### OneDrive

Make sure the _Always keep on this device_ option is enabled for the folder on both computers:

If you are using Linux, you can use @abraunegg's non-official [OneDrive client for Linux](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive).
